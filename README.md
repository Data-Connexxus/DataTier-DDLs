# Database Definitions
The easiest thing we could have done is make this a complete SaaS-based offering. We are cognizant of the potential for
partners to build out potential service offerings down the road. We also want to ensure that organizations can
have control of the data.

## Pre-Requisites
Ensure you have all the tools needed to be installed and configured. 

1. RDBMS or data platform setup with security and connectivity installed and configured.
2. A clone or unzipped download of the DataTier-DDL repository.
3. If this is an enterprise or SaaS-provided database, you must ensure you have an account capable of creating
   databases and adding extensions. If you are not allowed those permissions, then admins will need to create the
   database and possibly run the ddl script within the database to create all the data objects.

# Running The Database Definition (DDL)
- Load up your favorite RDBMS management tool or command line, get the latest script for the database technology you are implementing, and run it.
- Go to the specific database and ensure that the script runs and all the tables and objects are created against the script.


Happy coding!!!
